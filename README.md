# Cpp-practice-codes
I took procedural programming and currently taking object oriented programming as part of my courses for my first and second semesters respectively. These codes are practice codes i write. some are from materials i am learning from whereas some are also mine. such will be noted in post description.
codes from learning materials assist my versions i'd write and subsequently the personal independent ones i write.
